    "body": "Dream: I got out of my home to go to my office.. It was overcast, no sun in the sky, and gloomy light. I see a dead deer as soon as I get out of my home.. as I move ahead, I see two more dead deer. The deer carcasses were covered by hundreds of crows/ravens eating them. So many that you could almost not see the deer carcasses. A little bit further, there was a bride and some kind of a wedding gathering. The bride was dressed in the usual bridal white.. guests in black tuxedos. My way forward was blocked by the wedding guests and some kind of a iron gate.\n\nI am at a loss to interpret this.. the imagery matches nothing I have ever seen in real life.. nor was there any conversation with any one."

    "body": "I have been having dreams (go figure) about dead deer. My life has gone through alot changes with death, moving homes, and lots of other complicated stuff.\n\nBut for the last few nights I’ve been dreaming of dead deer.\n\nThe first one was: I was in one of my old houses. During some sort of family gathering?? I walked outside into the large front yard and there was this large central tree. I walked up because woah, cool tree, and there I saw laying beneath it a dead deer. The deer itself was mostly intact save for it having a large gaping cavity in it’s chest with its ribs being visible. A part of me felt excited because I’ve always had a weird interest with bones so I thought nothing of it. Then I awoke.\n\nSecond dream: I was in another one of my old houses , I don’t remember alot of it but for some reason one of my friends opened the door and there was this alligator outside then he quickly shut the door. I went around to the back exit of the house to avoid the alligator and when I went into the backyard , I saw the same tree with the same dead deer, with the same disemboweled rib cage.\n\nCan anyone provide any insight into what this means?"

There was a buck eating a fox with a cottontail rabbit impaled on its right antler outside of my bedroom window. I’m normally not afraid of deer but it looked directly at me and I suddenly felt terrified. After a few seconds of locking eyes with it I closed my blinds and curled up in bed facing the opposite direction of the window feeling like It was still watching me. Also i don’t think I was fully asleep during the last part. My blinds were open when I went to sleep and were closed in the morning. And I did text my girlfriend at the time about it a few minutes after just laying there and I saw the text that I sent in the morning."

    "body": "I’m sharing this dream for helping interpreting it, but also just to share a really wholesome dream that I had. I dreamt that I was in my grandparents front yard and there were a bunch of deer and their babies with me. A mama and her fawn came up to me and they started talking to me. I forget what we talked about specifically, but they were very friendly. I remember telling them I had to take a test and that I would let them know when I finished so they could come back. They then trotted away. The fawn went on its momma’s back, like splooted, it was so cute! Deer live in the forest, and the forest symbolizes the unconscious mind. They came to visit me from the forest, so maybe some things are emerging from my subconscious mind. The baby being there makes me think that the dream could symbolize new fresh beginnings in my life. Maybe the test I had to take with symbolic of spiritual trials; maybe my innocence had to be pushed back to my subconscious mind, until the trials are over. What do you guys think? :)"

    "body": "Simply put, I have had a reoccurring nightmare where no matter what I dream, the ending always ends up the same.\n\nIt begins at night. Usually I am with someone. There are two paths, continuing straight ahead or turning right. Next to the right path is a stag sitting alert. Usually I proceed forward avoiding the stag where I see two deer sitting, blocking the other path. I then back up and try heading back the first way but the deer starts to snort.\n\nI grow fearful of the deer and back up, turning around and heading into this wooden shed of some sort. The door is paper thin and doesn’t have a handle, so I hold the door closed with the hook. I usually wait it out, crying hysterically as the aggressive stag tries to force entry to attack me. At this point I am alone as the stag has only targeted me and the person I am with ends up leaving the way we came, leaving me to deal with the deer alone.\n\nI am usually pretty good at interpreting dreams and their meanings behind them but I can’t seem to understand why something as peaceful as a deer would attack me. To be fair I did have a dream a capybara chased me so I guess this isn’t too far fetched. Any ideas of what it may mean are welcome!"

    "body": "Hello,\n\nI just woke up from a dream which I cannot process. I n the dream, I am standing at my courtyard in back of my house.\n\nTwo of my friends came, one with a gun for hunting in one's hand. Then I saw two deers, a big one standing back side of my house and a small deer standing nearby us, but only I saw the small one. Friend with the gun shot at the big one, it missed. But the bullet was like a boomerang and it came towards us, but we dodged. Then I pointed my friend towards the small deer and he shot it. The bullet didn't kill the deer, but it definitely hurt and was dying. I thought of eating it after proper 'halal slaughtering', so I went back to house for getting a knife. My family was against it, as hunting is illegal and they were expecting some family guest coming home that day and didn't wanted that guests find out. I was backing out from killing the deer, but saw a person I know saying it is not a problem and no issue will be there. After thinking and gathering courage, I got the knife and went back, but my friends were not there with deer. To search for them, I used the gate in my backyard to go to road via neighbours courtyard. (I saw the old house of neighbours, but they flattened it years before and is in a new one as of now in its place). I found out, there is a marriage happening at another neighbour's house. When I saw the people, I hid the knife behind and pushing it inside my pant, but people was looking at me, and I thought they might be seeing the knife. I went to road and asked for my friends, but no one know.\n\nHow can this be interpreted?"

Last night I had a dream that I was walking to go visit my grandmother. As I was walking I saw a black bear eating a deer. I was scared but I was able to run away without it noticing me. However, I had a deep feeling of sadness for the deer.\n\nFast forward…When I was finally with my grandmother she fell and she was in lots of pain. I was holding my grandmother and rocking her back and fourth until the deer came back. The deer walked up to my grandmother and I and stood patiently next to us. I started crying, the deep feeling of sadness came rushing back but this time, I also had an extremely deep feeling of relief as if I was seeing a deceased loved one once again.\n\nMy main concern is my grandmother. She isn’t doing the greatest health wise. When I see people in my dreams it most often means something is going on or something is about to happen. This week i’ve been seeing her in my dreams every single time. But this dream just struck me the most.\n\nIf anyone has an idea of how i can interpret this i’d love to hear what you all have to say :) Thank you!"

    "body": "This dream happened in late Nov. 2024…\n\nIt was storming outside, there was a small tornado right above me, it lifted me up my feet, but I managed to ground myself back on the floor and went into this building that happened to be a bakery.\n\nI picked up my baked goods and sat at a table by myself. There was this annoying guy, trying to grab attention until he signaled to look the other way, so I looked at the large square shaped window.\n\nThere was a beautiful mountain scenery 🏔️🌲☁️ with tall forest trees and a misty/foggy background. It almost reminded me of Colorado or Oregon. In the foreground there was this LARGE majestic white deer (it looked male, because of its size) with golden antlers, staring right at me.. It was so beautiful I cannot look away. It’s aura seem to radiate gold and it was a silent moment between us. I felt peaceful looking at it. In the background, I saw smaller baby brown deer frolicking & they were jumping so high into the sky… I questioned how was that possible?!? No one else in the building saw this besides me… by the time, I looked back, it was gone.\n\nMy dream 💭 interpretation : 1. Maybe the white deer was a spirit guide/ a reflection of myself, and the baby deer jumping was a reminder that the sky is limitless (pertaining to my dreams and aspirations)… 2.) but I also feel the deer could be an authoritative figure and the baby deer could represent fertility?\n\nAs for the environment scene, I do spend a lot of time in the mountains to unwind. And I recently went on a trip to Oregon and pictured my life there because of the nature scenery… & a couple months ago I’ve been wanting to take a trip to Colorado for some reason…\n\nI would like you to share your thoughts ?

    "link": "https://old.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/1hycl2j/dark_pagoda_ritual_a_celtic_death_deer_goddess/",
    "body": "So, I had this insane dream… It felt like a game scenario. A group of us were searching for some artifact, and our main character (the protagonist) was cursed. We finally found the artifact, but then a goddess appeared—she had a green deer that reminded me of something out of a Zelda game.\n\nBack at our base, there was a pagoda where people were preparing a ritual. They set fire to the pagoda as part of the rite, which was meant to use half the soul of an elder spirit (a really nice lady) to merge with the goddess—because the goddess supposedly had the other half of the protagonist’s soul. As the ritual began, everything dimmed, and the protagonist started to turn dark. The goddess showed up in this terrifying form, and the other companions tried to confront her, but she was too powerful. The protagonist was literally running for his life, feeling like he was about to have a heart attack.\n\nAt one point, the goddess stopped in front of another goddess (a rival, apparently) who didn’t try to fight. She asked if this rival goddess belonged to a certain “author.” When the rival said no—she belonged to someone with a weird Finnish name—the dark goddess got enraged. She transformed into something like a burning red pagoda, with star-like shapes and totem poles pointing in direction of the base, her face turned into a totem, like side view from the screen in a shamanic style. Darkness followed her command, bringing creatures and maledictions, then using one of the shadows the screen transition.\n\nMeanwhile, back at the burning pagoda at base where the ritual continued: people were struggling. Food and water were being passed around, but the fire made everything difficult—water was too hot to drink, walls were too hot to touch. Oddly enough, as long as dinner continued inside the pagoda, everyone was safe. But then something went wrong: a fight broke out among some side characters, the ones I was supposed to improve friendship levels with. A lady who was in charge of the water left the pagoda by climbing out a window to confront another woman who tossed water at them. Because of this, the ritual was interrupted.\n\nThe moment the ritual broke, everything started to crumble. Panic set in, the maledicts possed everthing that closely resemble totems, scaring and showing away people on the vilage around the pagoda so they stoped the rites, then darkness took over, and in that transition, I had control of my character again. The objective was to find the pagoda in the dark, but since I hadn’t completed certain missions (and didn’t remember the route), I got completely lost. With no guiding fire, I ended up with a bad ending: I was devoured by this Celtic death deer goddess. Inside her mouth, I saw these gray, skeletal arches—five of them on the roof of her mouth. The last thing I witnessed before being chomped was the other half of my soul leaving my body and going to her, while she laughed with a horribly satisfied expression.\n\nSurprisingly, I didn’t wake up at that point. I ended up at the game’s main menu, only to realize my save file was erased. In the dream, I was super upset, complaining to my sister that this was “bullshit game design.” I discovered another save file that was somewhere in the middle of the story, but I decided to just shut off the game. That’s when I finally woke up in real life"

They were all like omg how cool, but i didnt fuck with them especially in groups like that. For some reason my sister had my cat in her arms and was bringing him up to a deer to show him it and i was like dude stop wtf are you doing. (Ive seen vids of deer fighting cats lol.) But she did anyways and ended up dropping him and the deer were trying to stomp on him and he ran on the other side of the fence where there were even more deer forming. So i hopped the fence and several deer were trying to attack me kicking or trying to gorge me with antlers. They were abnormal looking now, dirty and vile. However i got him, thankfully. I picked him up and carried him into the house. I was now alone.\n\nThe front door was cracked open a tiny bit but I was sure I remembered closing it. I just knew something or someone evil was inside waiting for me. I was frozen in the foyer wondering if i should grab my gun or just leave. I knew i was dreaming at this point since it was such a light sleep but i could not change where i was.\n\nI remember thinking inside and out of the dream that i should NOT look into a mirror in my dream because i would see something terrifying. I had an overwhelming urge to do so anyways and i was imagining what sort of monstrosity was going to be staring back at me. Warped demonic face? Horribly disfigured version of what i recall to be my own reflection? Someone behind me ready to end my life in the worst way my subconscious could come up with? I was able to finally wake myself up before i looked."

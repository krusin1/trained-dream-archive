    "body": "I need to share this because it‚Äôs been driving me crazy.\n\nThis started earlier this year. I had a dream in which I saw a large house on top of a hill. I recognized it from a previous dream, so I decided to go check it out. Inside, the house was relatively bare, except for a girl‚Äîsomewhere in her 20s or 30s, with shoulder length brown hair‚Äîwho asked me what I was doing there.\n\nI explained that I had seen the house in a dream before and wanted to investigate. When I mentioned that I was dreaming, she was shocked:\n\n‚ÄúYou mean you‚Äôre dreaming too?!‚Äù\n\nWe realized we were in a shared dream. We talked briefly about our real lives and about trying to find each other once we woke up. She suggested social media, but I explained I don‚Äôt really use it. (I created this account today solely to make this post.)\n\nShortly after, I woke up. The dream stuck with me for quite a while, but months went by, and I started to think of it as maybe just a weird fluke‚Äîuntil I ran into her again.\n\nI was passing through a group of people when we both recognized each other and freaked out a bit that this was happening again. This time, we were more determined to get in touch. She gave me her number, and I wrote it on my hand, but when I woke up, I could only remember the area code.\n\nIt‚Äôs been months, and I haven‚Äôt been able to shake this experience. If you, ,or maybe a friend, mentioned meeting a sentient early 20s white guy in a dream earlier this year, please DM me with any info to see if it lines up with my dreams. This could include:\n\nWhat the house on the hill looked like\nWhat she/you told me she did for a living\nThe area code I was given\n\nPlease upvote for visibility‚ÄîI need to know if this is more than a coincidence.",

I then realized that an evacuation order must have been put into place and the lanes were reversed to ease traffic flow.\n\nI had never heard of it until that dream, but when I looked it up the next day, I learned about how some highways will have the lanes reversed and exits closed off for hurricane evacuation.

We were in a white car, driving fast down a road I didn‚Äôt recognize, being chased by people on motorcycles. One of them caught up with us, intercepted the car, and others surrounded us.

I couldn't sleep well for days.\n\nFive years later, I bought my first car ‚Äî a white Toyota. One Wednesday, it was stolen. A few days later, the thieves contacted me, asking for $1,000 to return it. I agreed. While waiting in a park with my father for the car to arrive, I suddenly turned my head and saw the exact same street from my dream. It all came back to me in seconds. I stood up and told my dad, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go ‚Äî they‚Äôre going to kill us.‚Äù He looked skeptical, but we left.\n\nDriving away, I saw the exact trees, the exact curve, the same visual composition I had dreamed years before. I believe that dream saved our lives, and that in another timeline, we died that day.\n\nApproximate date of dream: 1998\nReal-life event: 2003\nDid the dream come true?: Yes, but I changed the ending\n\nHas anyone else had a dream that prevented a tragedy before it happened?",

He has some corgi, beagle vibes, but we never really knew. So, this shiba dog was said to be my irl dog's half brother and we were in the process of adopting him.\n\nWe brought this new dog to our house.

I was living in 1984‚Äîcassette tapes, arcades, neon windbreakers‚Äîand¬†Dog Man¬†had just been released as a brand-new children‚Äôs book. But instead of Dav Pilkey, the author was a 12-year-old Mexican-American girl named Sophie Perez, born in 1972. She had already written¬†Captain Underpants¬†back in 1980, and now¬†Dog Man¬†was the hot new release.\n\nThe launch took place in San Diego, and it was a huge cultural moment. Bookstores were packed, kids were reading it on the playground, and Sophie was being interviewed on TV like she was the next Judy Blume. I remember walking past a Waldenbooks and seeing a cardboard cutout of Dog Man wearing leg warmers and holding a boombox. It was peak ‚Äô80s.\n\nThen the dream took a turn‚Äîa full-blown nightmare.\n\nSuddenly, I was inside a mall during what people were calling ‚ÄúThe Dog Man Rush‚Äù‚Äîbasically Black Friday, but for¬†Dog Man¬†books. People were stampeding through aisles, knocking over displays, grabbing stacks of books like they were rare collectibles. Security guards were shouting, kids were crying, and someone threw a copy of¬†Captain Underpants¬†like a frisbee and hit me in the head.\n\nI tried to grab a copy of¬†Dog Man¬†for myself, but the shelves were already bare. Then alarms started going off. A voice over the intercom said:\n\nI ducked behind a rack of Trapper Keepers to avoid the chaos‚Äîand that‚Äôs when I saw something surreal. My dad, as a teenager, was in the middle of a shouting match with another teen over the last copy of¬†Dog Man. And that other teen? My best friend‚Äôs dad. They were both trying to grab the book at the same time, yelling stuff like ‚ÄúI saw it first!‚Äù and ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt even read!‚Äù It was like watching history glitch in real time.\n\nEventually, they both gave up and started laughing, like they‚Äôd just bonded over the madness. I watched them walk off together, joking like old friends, while the mall descended into chaos around them.\n\nI escaped through a side exit and saw Sophie Perez being driven away in a limo, waving to the crowd like a rock star. I woke up sweating and confused.\n\nHave you ever had a dream about¬†Dog Man¬†or anything similar?",

But when I take a seat, the incredulous driver-bodyguard asks who the fuck I am, and I just cheerfully reply, \"a friend\" (probably because I have no friends irl lol). But Putin himself isn't there, so I go out and start walking alongside him, and finally ask a question, \"What if Russia and Poland went to war because of insignificant, mosquito-like drone strikes?\" And he responded with something confusing like, \"there is a time of day for everything\"? Not too sure what he meant - that drone strikes usually occur at night? Or that the freemasons have it all going according to plan (\"trust the plan\")? Either way, I was super excited so I just politely thanked with a thick Ukrainian accent (I can't speak Russian properly lol) and went the opposite way. On the way back, I was somewhat wondering why the fuck would a president talk to me, but I rationalised it as that even the heads of state are NPCs (\"golems\").\n\nThen I realised my home was that same way I had just gone the opposite direction of, so I went the same way again, but ofc no Putin this time. Instead, I saw a bright light in the sky, but I could look at it, so it was likely the Moon. But the shadow I was casting made no sense (Apollo denial flashbacks), so I looked behind, but only saw the stars (yay, saw stars in a dream!). Then kept going, and found 3-4 dogs pacing along, but they were neutral (sometimes they attack me in dreams, although never anything gruesome, just annoying). And so I had a voice say, \"Dogs live different lives than the owners they serve\".\n\nMild post-factum explanation - I treat Putin as one of the globalist leaders, and I wonder if the freemasons truly have a plan for the next few years/centuries, or whether they're making up nonsense as they go along. Or maybe there are no freemasons at all, and it's all just nonsense from start to finish, haha.",

    "body": "My dead dog from 21 years ago was in my childhood backyard from 33 years ago with my dead cat from last year both hanging out with my current cat who's alive.\n\nWhen I saw my dead dog and dead cat, I thought and felt in the dream, \"it's been a long time since I visited you, I don't know how you've been alive all this time without food.\"\n\nI had another cat that died in 2022 but he wasnt in the dream, however my dad who's alive in real life, comes out of no where and says this cat has good luck dodging bullets but he was never shot at while he was alive. He died of kidney failure.\n\nMy dead dog and dead cat were both happy to see me and I was surprised they got a long, because my dog used to want to kill cats. They never met in real life and I had them in different time lines decades apart.\n\nI woke up feeling so good knowing I had a non stop busy job to help me take the painful memory away. Without this job, I would be super depressed moping around wishing they were all still alive.",

    "body": "Disclaimer: this is quite long because I'm not kidding when I say I just woke up and I'm trying to preserve every detail in my dream.\n\nMy dog recently passed away, just a couple of days ago. It was‚Äîstill is‚Äîsuch a sudden, agonizing and traumatic event for me because the days leading up to her death, I felt like I had been neglecting due to a number of factors that had been clawing at my attention. I know I took her existence for granted, thinking that because she was so full of life and energy even at her age, she would probably live past 20. The inner turmoil has been so bad that I've been contemplating on taking my own life (now it's just a matter of picking the right time).\n\nUntil today, I didn't dream of her. I was even feeling a bit sad because I thought I must have been so awful to her she decided it wasn't worth visiting me in my dreams. In the dream, I was in my house asking my brother to run errands for me and buy me donuts. When I went upstairs to my room, I opened the door, and to my surprise two of my dogs came rushing out‚Äîincluding her. Barking ever so loudly with an ear-screeching high pitch that I've come to miss so fucking much. They started running around in circles, blazing down the stairs, likely because they smelled the donuts.\n\nAt first I didn't think much of it and surmised my depression must have gotten so bad I've begun hallucinating vividly. Her figure seemed a bit hazy at times, like it wasn't solid. But then she didn't go away. She ran up and jumped on to me with her tiny little legs. I managed to pick her up and brush through her soft fur again. It was surreal. She ran to the kitchen where I met a former resident of the house (I won't go into much details but she used to also work for us and live with us). I was crying and asking her while pointing at my dog, \"You can see her right? I'm not just making this up?\" She looked taken aback as she said, \"Yes. She's here. Your brother didn't tell you? I even got goosebumps after hearing the story.\"\n\nShe said that in the funeral parlor where she was about to be cremated, a worker was complaining that the crematorium was extremely hot already and now he had to look after a dog too. His co-worker was confused, and asked what he meant by that, and he explained that one of the dogs he was supposed to cremate came back to life and he had been feeding her since then. Then they apparently went back and forth with their convo, the co-worker asking him to just hurry up because their boss is coming back soon.\n\nMy dream then shifted sceneries, and I was now in a pet shop (like a Petsmart). I was browsing through Halloween pet costumes, a purple witch costume was 10% off (I always loved dressing my baby girl in purple, I felt like it was her color). All I was thinking then was that I have to get her a costume so I could take her to parties with me and we'd be matching. I wanted to make it up to her by taking her everywhere with me from now on. My dog was also with me, running through the aisles and under the store shelves. A worker, I believe the same one who was bantering with the worker who took care of her at the crematorium, came up to me and asked how she could help and if I could hurry up because their boss was coming soon.\n\nAt that moment I woke up. I expected tears, but my face was completely dry. I felt hollow. But I whispered a thank you to her for visiting me. Yet now the doom and gloom that has been plaguing me for days has grown even more immense. That dream gave me such false hope, I truly believed a miracle happened and she was alive. I don't know what to make of her visit, and all I'm thinking is I have to be quick and join her already so she wouldn't feel so lonely.\n\nTLDR; my dog visited me in my dreams for the first time since she passed away, and I was made to believe that a miracle happened the last minute and she came back alive while she was scheduled to be cremated. Now I don't know what to make of that dream other than I need to be with her again.",

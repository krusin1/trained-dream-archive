He asked me to stay a while and if I could buy a naughty soul from him to buy him bunny Boba food (I don't know what made them naughty, probably evil people's souls.)\n\nI remember seeing a framed photo of the bunny behind him, and that it was a moving/live picture where the bunny was moving around in a grassfield. I got the impression that this really old looking man loved his bunny very much. He mentioned that he sold them for 14.99 $ each, and in my head I was like \"that is a great deal for a soul,\" so I said I'd buy one, but before I could I woke up. When I woke up I was wondering why I would even purchase a soul lmao",

    "body": "This one is extremely strange, so get prepared. I wrote this one down right after I had it.\n\nI was dreaming about showing Who Framed Roger Rabbit to my little brother, but the version I showed was severely different to the one that actually exists. I remember hearing about a scene in an old Disney film that shows a children’s nursery rhyme being sung, yet it’s in reverse for some reason, this understandably terrified children. In this version of Roger Rabbit, there were a-lot of things different, like Roger lives in a Garden or something and gets hit in the head with a trowel and has to cover up his head to hide a cut??? I don’t know at this point, anyway, so him and Eddie end up hiding somewhere, it looks like an ally way, Jessica shows up saying she hates Roger???? And then the movie turns to black, and for whatever reason, this is where that nursery rhyme scene comes in, even… though its not in this movie but okay. The scene starts with a really strange image, its a painted picture of a dog with blood around its left eye, its just staring into the camera, with a completed blank face. It fades away as if it was thunder and lightning, then the camera pans to a somewhat prison looking place? I’m guessing its a school, these are all drawings, the sky is blood red and the foreground is just completely black, it seems familiar for some reason… anyway, when the camera pans into the prison? It fades to a different shot of real life children singing this reversed nursery rhyme. In the dream where I was showing the movie to my brother, I remember flinching when seeing that picture of a dog with blood, I don’t remember my brother’s reaction, but I do remember mine. Whenever I watch Roger Rabbit, I always want to stay till the end. Sure the film’s a bit creepy, but I still want to watch it, but this time felt different, have you ever felt that feeling of just being… uncomfortable and really wanting to leave, yeah, that’s what I was feeling watching the scene. It’s probably because I was always uncomfortable being in those places like Kids Clubs or Daycares, something always just feels so unsafe about them and I always wanted to go back to my parents, and this same feeling was happening here. Then I gladly woke up.\n\nAn important thing to mention is that I was still kind of awake, just still in bed, waiting to get up. Anyway, thats my dream!",

All of which have just been normal for me, no nightmares or anything.\n\nSo I started typing them into chatgpt as an experiment and told it to interpret them, and what emotions I might be processing behind them. Anyway, it’s been super interesting and mostly very accurate. But at the same time, putting so much effort into journalling has heightened my recall even more so.\n\nToday as I was napping, I had the most terrifying dream experience of my life. I can type the whole thing out into the comments if anyone is interested but the essential part is that I was dreaming, and had a nightmare within the dream. So I had the nightmare (where a literal evil entity held me still while pinching me and spoke to me) and then I woke up, but it turns out I had “woken up” into another dream. I couldn’t remember what the entity actually said, I was just feeling incredibly scared. I was now in the movie theatre with my family feeling highly distressed when the screen changed and it LITERALLY REPLAYED MY NIGHTMARE back to me and to everyone. So I had some sort of panic attack and felt like I was crazy. Then I actually woke up.\n\nWould love some thoughts on this, maybe I need to stop analysing so much? It felt like a warning.",

    "body": "I'd been trying to find a good place to post this, and so far this subreddit is my best bet.\n\nI had a dream two nights ago where I had been looking after this young girl. Most of what happened was a blur, but the parts I remember are as follows;\n\n👉 The girl was trans, and her mother wanted my family and I specifically to look after her since we were also queer and a safe household. 👉 There was a mysterious hallway that appeared that wasn't there previously. It was in the style of padded rooms, but it had one window by the entrance and it stretched off into unknowable darkness. We were not permitted to explore this hallway. 👉 We were told to stay away from the windows for our safety, as there would likely be people outside that meant to cause us harm (me, my brother and the girl) 👉 At one point, and Elon Musk lookalike was parked outside in one of those cringe ass cybertrucks, talking with some construction workers. The three of us laughed when we saw him, and he drove off in a huff. 👉 I decided to take the girl out for some lunch, and we passed by those construction workers the dude was talking to. They seemed stumped as to why they were having trouble taking down an abandoned, run down house.\n\nFinally, the girl and I arrive at this café/ restaurant where you have to prepare your own food. I decided to cook for the both of us, and was actually having a pretty fun time up until an arm reached from under the tables and snatched the girl. She was gone before I could do anything to save her.\n\nThat's when It appeared.\n\nIt approached me, and I panicked, swinging at its face and dislocating its mask. In the eeriest voice I've ever heard in a dream, it said in an almost sing-songy tone, \"ooohhh... what did you dooo..~?\" and I could see a single eye, glaring at me from behind the dangling mask. I was tripping over myself trying to apologize and defend myself when it grabbed me by the arm, repeating the phrase \"Take it back. Take it back. TAKE IT BACK.\" and after the third time, I woke up in a dark cell.\n\nI was in the creature's basement, the room only being lit up by the distant moon through a tiny window. It was at this point that I completely lost it, and in a state of desperation, I shouted \"PAUSE!!!\" To my relief, everything seemed to stop as a small game menu took up my vision. In spite of the big red text that read \"pause\" at the top of the screen, I couldn't tell if time was still moving or not. There was a clock in the room, but the hands were missing. Figuring I didn't have much time, I dug around the menu for any useful information regarding my situation and found that I was supposed to be up against at least four different iterations of The White Rabbit, all of which were just amimatronic copies that were deteriorated in different ways. There was also an iteration of Vanny present (from FNaF: Security Breach), but her presence was so non-threatening that it calmed my nerves a bit. I remember pulling out my phone to ask Reddit about \"How do I defeat the White Rabbit?\" and that's about when I woke up.\n\nA few things to note about this rabbit;\n\n👉 To those familiar with FNaF, this rabbit was not William Afton, the creature from Into the Pit, or the mobs from FNaF World. It was like an unholy combination of the three, while feeling like an entirely new entity all together. 👉 The White Rabbit's voice was like if you took Patrick Star's voicelines from season 2 of SpongeBob and applied the same deepness and distortion as Bon/ The Pumpkin Rabbit from The Walten Files. (this sounds absurd, but it's the best way I can describe it, and I promise it sounded way scarier in the dream.) 👉 Finally, while the drawing I made isn't exactly what The White Rabbit looked like, it's pretty close.\n\nTL;DR: scary rabbit kidnaps child, I punched it, it screamed at me and it locked me in its basement. I was scared shitless and eventually woke up. It took me two days to get the drawing right.",
